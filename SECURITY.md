## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately:

We aim to respond within 48 hours. Once validated, fixes will be prioritized and the README will be updated with mitigation steps if necessary.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Provide steps to reproduce, including any proof-of-concept.
- If the issue involves sensitive data or credentials, redact them before sharing.
- Give us time to remediate before any public disclosure.

Thank you for helping improve the security of this project!
